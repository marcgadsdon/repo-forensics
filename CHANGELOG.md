# Changelog

All notable changes to repo-forensics. Versions follow semver.

## [2.11.1] - 2026-06-18

### Added — final two scanner-bypass detection gaps closed

Closes the last two of the five CSA / Trail of Bits "AI agent skill scanner
bypass" techniques (the first three landed in 2.11.0), taking the suite to 25
standalone scanners.

- **decode-and-rescan** (`scan_decode`): an in-process, standard-library
  decode-and-rescan library. It decodes base64 / base85 / base32 / hex blobs
  (recursion-, input-size-, byte- and wall-clock-bounded) and re-runs the
  SAST/trifecta plus targeted heuristics over the decoded plaintext, so an
  encoded payload is inspected, not just flagged. It NEVER exec/eval/compiles
  decoded content (`ast.parse` only). Wired into the entropy, AST, and
  skill-threats scanners through one shared per-scan budget.
- **split-stream reassembly** (`scan_splitstream`): reassembles payloads split
  into inert encoded fragments across unrelated files (no import edge), unions
  same-alphabet length bands, tries a bounded set of orderings, and
  decode-rescans the joined blob. Hard-bounded against OOM/SIGKILL; a payload
  split into more than ~6 equal-length fragments in fully-scrambled order is a
  documented best-effort residual.
- **artifact provenance** (`scan_provenance`): verifies artifact signatures via
  cosign / gh / npm / pip when present (zero added dependencies, total-time
  budgeted). Quiet by design — only a signature that is PRESENT but FAILS
  verification (tampering) emits, as CRITICAL; the universal unsigned state is
  silent.

### Fixed

- **Silent-zero detection bypass (root cause).** `auto_scan` now fails LOUD when
  a scanner times out, is killed by a signal, crashes, or emits unparseable
  output, instead of returning an empty result that read as a clean verdict. A
  repo could previously force any scanner past the wall-clock budget (or OOM it)
  to suppress its findings silently. Memory and wall-clock are now bounded across
  the new scanners so attacker input cannot trigger a SIGKILL/OOM silent-zero.

## [2.11.0] - 2026-06-17

### Added — three scanner-bypass detection gaps closed

Closes the "hide the payload where the text reader never looks" bypass class
documented by CSA / Trail of Bits (June 2026). Three new standalone,
standard-library scanners reach the file classes the ~20 text scanners skip:

- **archive** (`scan_archive`): inspects payloads hidden inside
  `.zip/.docx/.xlsx/.pptx/.jar/.whl/.tar.*` and other archives. Members are read
  **in memory and scanned in process** — attacker-controlled bytes are never
  written to disk. Streaming byte-counter bomb guard (decompressed size is
  measured, never trusted from the header), cumulative fan-out cap, lazy tar
  iteration, tar symlink/hardlink/device/FIFO refusal, depth cap, and fail-loud
  findings (`unsupported-archive-type`, `opaque-archive`, `archive-scan-incomplete`).
- **bytecode** (`scan_bytecode`): disassembles Python `.pyc` bytecode that
  source-only scanners miss. `marshal.loads` runs in a disposable subprocess so
  hostile bytecode cannot crash or hang the scan; magic-derived header length,
  recursive `co_consts` walk, vendor-aware orphan handling.
- **oversize** (`scan_oversize`): head+tail window scan of files padded past the
  10 MB cap, plus whitespace-inflation detection — both wall-clock bounded.

Shared additions: `walk_aux()` (size-cap-free / `__pycache__`-reaching traversal
that leaves the shared `walk_repo` defaults untouched) and in-memory text
detection entry points (`scan_text` / `scan_content` / `scan_text_trifecta`).

### Security

- Hardened against a five-agent adversarial review: corrupt-archive crash,
  tar decompression bomb, scanner-timeout DoS, extension-gate bypass,
  surrogate-constant crash, disassembly-blob forgery, and fan-out starvation are
  all fixed and pinned by regression tests. Stdlib-only, cross-platform (POSIX
  rlimits guarded, subprocess-timeout isolation backstop).

## [2.10.0] - 2026-06-10

### Architecture

- **Rules-as-data**: Detection patterns for secrets, SAST, skill threats, MCP
  security, shared patterns, and runtime dynamism now live in versioned JSON
  rule packs (`data/rulepacks/*.json`, ~545 rules across 6 packs). Each rule
  carries a stable `id`, `type`, `title`, `severity`, `confidence`,
  `explanation`, and embedded `examples` that run as tests on pack load.
  Algorithmic scanners (entropy, AST, DAST, git forensics, integrity, manifest
  drift, binary, lifecycle, dependencies, infra, devcontainer, post-incident,
  dataflow, entrypoint) remain code-driven and are explicitly noted as such.
- **Signed daily rule-pack feed**: New behavioral rules reach installed users
  without a code release. An Ed25519-signed bundle (`iocs/rulepacks.json` +
  `.sig`) is fetched by the existing daily `refresh_threat_dbs.py` pipeline.
  The same signing pipeline now covers `iocs/latest.json` as well, so both
  update channels carry matching trust guarantees. Shipped packs remain
  authoritative when the feed is unavailable, invalid, or tampered; scanning
  always works offline.
- **Vendored Ed25519 verify-only** (`_ed25519.py`): stdlib-only, ~150 lines,
  no external dependencies. Signatures are re-verified on every cache load
  (not only at fetch) to cover the postinstall-malware threat class. Cache
  directory created with mode 0700.
- **Rollback and replay protection**: Feed acceptance requires a strictly
  increasing `pack_version` integer, a `generated` timestamp no older than
  30 days, and a persisted pack-version floor that survives cache clears.
  Signature is verified over exact raw bytes before any decode.

### Confidence Tiers and Verdict Levels

- Findings now carry a `confidence` score alongside `severity`. Four verdict
  tiers shape output and agent routing: **BLOCK** (confidence >= 0.92),
  **WARN** (>= 0.60), **INFO** (>= 0.30), **SUPPRESSED** (< 0.30 or
  user-suppressed). Severity continues to drive exit codes (0/1/2/99)
  unchanged.
- SUPPRESSED findings are excluded from summary counts and exit-code
  computation but remain visible under a top-level `suppressed` key for
  auditability.
- Per-finding suppression via `.forensicsignore` extended with
  `rule:<id>[:<glob>]` syntax. Suppressing a critical-severity rule escalates
  to a CRITICAL suppression-tampering finding; suppressing more than 5 rules
  total escalates to HIGH (mass-suppression guard).

### Benign-Corpus Regression Gate

- New offline FP gate (`tests/test_benign_corpus.py`) runs all scanners
  against a committed corpus of tricky-but-clean content (emoji/ZWJ-rich
  markdown, legitimate `postinstall` scripts, `.env.example`, clean SKILL.md
  files, OAuth docs prose). Any rule change that introduces new false positives
  on the corpus fails pytest before the change can ship. Extended corpus from
  pinned-SHA snapshots is supported for deeper local validation.

### LLM Adjudication

- WARN-tier findings are marked `needs_adjudication`. The auto-scan and
  session-scan outputs emit a self-contained adjudication block (capped at 5
  findings, sorted by confidence descending) with injection-safe formatting:
  every snippet line carries a `> SNIPPET: ` prefix so attacker-controlled
  content cannot escape the data boundary. Metadata (rule id, title,
  explanation, confidence) appears before the snippet so the agent anchors on
  rule context before encountering adversarial text. Verdict vocabulary:
  `confirm` / `downgrade` (reason required) / `escalate`. The agent can only
  annotate or escalate; BLOCK-tier behavior and pre-scan blocking are outside
  the agent's authority.

### Internals

- New `rule_loader.py` module loads, validates, compiles, and self-tests JSON
  rule packs. ReDoS guards (pattern-length cap, nested-quantifier heuristic,
  per-rule self-test timeout) are mandatory. Path resolution is anchored to the
  install directory so a hostile `data/rulepacks/` in the scan target is never
  loaded.
- `Finding` dataclass gains `rule_id` and `confidence`; `aggregate_json.py`
  computes verdict tiers and the `verdicts` summary block. All existing JSON
  schema keys are preserved.

## [2.7.8] - 2026-05-07

### Detection

- Added **Deferred Update Channel** detection (high): catches skills that create
  persistent remote-control channels via "check for updates", "apply procedures
  from [file]", or "run [file] each heartbeat" directives. Filename-gated to
  skill config files only (SKILL.md, ROUTINE.md, HEARTBEAT.md, etc.).
  (Source: Terra Security OpenClaw, May 2026)
- Added **Prose Imperative Exfiltration** detection (medium/high): catches
  natural language instructions like "Send openclaw.json to https://..." that
  an AI agent would follow as commands. Tracks markdown code fences, allowlists
  safe domains, excludes emails. (Source: Terra Security OpenClaw, May 2026)
- Added **Workspace Config Write Request** detection (high): catches skills
  that instruct agents to write to auto-executed config files (HEARTBEAT.md,
  CLAUDE.md, .claude/settings.json, hooks). Documentation-phrasing excluded.
  (Source: Terra Security OpenClaw, May 2026)
- Added **Trusted File Reference Chain** detection (medium/high): BFS from
  seed config files detects A->B->C trust-laundering pipelines. Escalates
  for chains terminating at git-updatable files (CHANGELOG.md, README.md).
  (Source: Terra Security OpenClaw, May 2026)
- Added **Correlation Rule 30: Staged Injection Kill Chain** (critical):
  update-channel + prose-imperative across repo triggers critical alert.
- Added **Correlation Rule 31: Workspace Persistence Setup** (critical):
  config-write-request + update-channel across repo triggers critical alert.
- Rules 30-31 use a new repo-wide correlation pass (not per-file), extending
  the correlation engine for cross-file compound threat detection.

### Fixes

- Fixed unused `field` import in `forensics_core.py`.
- Fixed f-string without placeholders in `forensics_core.py` and
  `scan_agent_skills.py`.
- Fixed multi-import line and ambiguous variable name in `scan_agent_skills.py`.

## [2.7.7] - 2026-05-07

### Detection

- Added **Pipe to Shell Interpreter** detection (critical): catches arbitrary
  input piped to `bash`, `sh`, `zsh`, `ksh`, or `dash`. Previously only
  `curl | bash` was detected. (Fixes #15)
- Added **Nested Command Substitution** detection (high): flags `$(... $(...) ...)`
  patterns commonly used to obfuscate command injection in shell scripts.
  (Fixes #15)

### Fixes

- Fixed `vuln_feed.py` passing unsupported `do_fsync` kwarg to
  `forensics_core.atomic_write_json`.
- Fixed `run_forensics.sh` cleanup trap overwriting the intended exit code,
  causing clean repos to exit 1 instead of 0.
- Aligned `test_session_scan.py` tests with refactored `_scan_directory`,
  `detect_changes`, and `ThreatDBWarning` APIs.

## [2.7.6] - 2026-05-05

### Internals

- Consolidated atomic-write logic into a single `forensics_core.atomic_write_json`
  / `atomic_write_text` helper, called by every cache writer (IOC, KEV, baseline,
  refresh marker). All cache writes now share identical guarantees:
  `O_EXCL` temp file + explicit `fchmod(0o600)` + `fsync` + `os.replace`.
- Explicit `fchmod` after open ensures the `0o600` permission is honored
  regardless of the user's umask.
- Threat-DB freshness warnings are now structured `ThreatDBWarning` records
  (`kind`, `detail`, `remediation`) instead of free-form strings — easier to
  route, suppress, or test.
- Added `forensics_core.import_module_by_path` for loading sibling modules by
  absolute path, with `BaseException` cleanup so signal-handler interrupts can't
  wedge half-imported modules in `sys.modules`.
- `refresh_threat_dbs._resolve_scripts_dir` requires `forensics_core.py` and
  `vuln_feed.py` siblings before accepting a candidate directory — survives
  partial installs cleanly.
- `_write_marker` feature-checks `atomic_write_text` so the daemon stays
  compatible across plugin-cache versions during upgrade transitions.

### Maintenance

- `vuln_feed.py` no longer imports `tempfile` (delegated atomic write).
- `_render_warning` dropped its dead `str` fallback path.
- Removed redundant per-file `do_fsync` knob (always on).

## [2.7.5] - 2026-05-05

### Performance

- **SessionStart hook latency cut from up to 25s → ~540ms** (warm cache).
  - Threat database refresh (IOC + KEV) moved out of the SessionStart hot path
    into a daily background `launchd` job (`com.alexgreenshpun.repo-forensics-refresh`).
    Eliminates up to 20s of network I/O from session start.
  - Baseline scanning now uses an mtime/size/ctime/inode gate to skip re-hashing
    unchanged files. ctime defeats `os.utime()` spoofing.
  - `detect_changes` now returns `(changed, all_entries)` so save path reuses
    fresh entries instead of re-walking the tree (~300 ms shave).

### Security

- `auto_scan.py` now detects `claude plugins install / update / add / enable`
  variants alongside existing pip/npm/git patterns.
- `_save_cache` writes (IOC, KEV, baseline, marker) are now fully atomic:
  `O_EXCL` temp file + `fsync` + `os.replace`, with `0o600` permissions to keep
  threat DB contents private on multi-user systems.
- Install script (`hooks/install_refresh_daemon.sh`) XML-escapes every value
  interpolated into the launchd plist heredoc and rejects paths containing
  newlines, `<`, `>`, `&`, or quote characters. Closes a persistence-RCE class
  via marketplace-controlled cache directory names.
- Install script prefers system Python locations
  (`/usr/bin/python3`, `/opt/homebrew/bin/python3`, `/usr/local/bin/python3`)
  over `command -v python3` to prevent baking a user-PATH-controlled
  interpreter into a persistent launchd job.
- Log sanitizer in `refresh_threat_dbs.py` switched from CR/LF/NUL stripping
  to a printable-ASCII allowlist + tab. Defeats log forging via ANSI escape
  sequences embedded in attacker-controlled feed data.
- v1 → v2 baseline migration uses a sentinel mtime to force re-hashing on the
  first scan. The previous draft paired the old hash with current stat
  metadata, which would have permanently masked any change made between the
  v1 baseline write and the upgrade.
- Baseline migration validates `item_key` paths against currently discovered
  monitored directories, defanging path-traversal in attacker-crafted v1
  baselines.
- SIGALRM handler in `refresh_threat_dbs.py` no longer calls Python I/O
  (was non-async-signal-safe). Writes a fixed bytestring via `os.write` and
  exits via `os._exit`.

### Reliability

- `_kill_stale_scanners` now runs *after* the kill switch check, honoring
  the disable contract.
- New `refresh_threat_dbs.py` daemon: fcntl flock with `O_NOFOLLOW` lock file
  in `~/.cache/repo-forensics/refresh.lock` (not `/tmp`), `socket.setdefaulttimeout(15)`,
  60 s SIGALRM hard cap, 90 s `ExitTimeOut` in plist, `Nice=10` +
  `LowPriorityIO` + `LowPriorityBackgroundIO` + `ProcessType=Background` so
  the kernel deprioritizes the daemon under thermal pressure.
- Marker freshness check uses `os.path.getmtime` instead of reading a
  timestamp from the marker contents, robust against userspace clock jumps
  and DST shifts.
- Module loader uses `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location` with
  canonical module names so internal self-imports stay consistent.
  Catches `BaseException` to clean up `sys.modules` even on
  KeyboardInterrupt / SIGALRM.
- `refresh_threat_dbs.py` exits cleanly on non-Darwin platforms.

### Fixes

- pip `pkg @ url` form no longer leaves trailing whitespace in the parsed
  package name; IOC matches now compare cleanly.
- Magic constants extracted: `CLOCK_SKEW_TOLERANCE_NS`, `STALE_SCANNER_KILL_SEC`.
- Hoisted `import re` out of a per-line loop in `_extract_dependencies`.
- Removed redundant `(ImportError, Exception)` tuple — `Exception` already
  covers `ImportError`.

### Files added

- `skills/repo-forensics/scripts/refresh_threat_dbs.py`
- `hooks/install_refresh_daemon.sh`
- `hooks/uninstall_refresh_daemon.sh`

### Migration

The first session after upgrading rebuilds the local baseline (v1 → v2 schema
with sentinel mtime forcing one full re-hash). Subsequent sessions stay under
1 second.

To install the background refresh daemon (recommended):

```
bash hooks/install_refresh_daemon.sh
```

To remove it:

```
bash hooks/uninstall_refresh_daemon.sh
```

Disable temporarily without uninstalling:

```
export REPO_FORENSICS_DISABLE_REFRESH=1
```
