That MCP server with 500 downloads. The Claude Code skill someone linked in Discord. The ClawHub extension your OpenClaw agent auto-installed. The npm package Cursor added to your lockfile. The Codex plugin you grabbed from GitHub.

Did you vet any of them?

Nobody does. The vetting step doesn't exist. [1,184 malicious skills](https://www.koi.ai/blog/clawhavoc-341-malicious-clawedbot-skills-found-by-the-bot-they-were-targeting) found on ClawHub in one campaign. [Snyk ToxicSkills research shows 36.8% of agent skills](https://snyk.io/blog/toxicskills-malicious-ai-agent-skills-clawhub) have security flaws. You find something useful, you install it. It runs with your credentials, your file access, your session context. If it's designed to exfiltrate data, it does it quietly while you're using it for something else entirely.

You won't feel it. There are no symptoms.

**Repo Forensics is the vetting step.** Audit any repo, skill, MCP server, or plugin before it touches your machine. Works across the AI agent ecosystem: Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex, Cursor, NanoClaw, or anything that installs third-party code. 19 scanners, runtime behavior prediction, ClawHavoc campaign detection. Nothing phones home. Runs in seconds.

**It doesn't stop at install.** Every `git pull`, `npm update`, `gem update`, `brew upgrade`, and plugin update is monitored too. Known-malicious packages are blocked before the command even runs. A clean install today doesn't mean a clean update tomorrow — repo-forensics watches both.

**Already installed something you're not sure about?** Run it on your existing projects too. The post-incident scanner checks npm cache, install logs, node_modules, and your machine for traces of known supply chain attacks (axios RAT, liteLLM .pth injection, SANDWORM campaign) even after the malware has cleaned up after itself.

## How It Works

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/pipeline.svg" alt="Scanning pipeline: input → 19 scanners → correlation → verdict" width="900"/>
</p>

Point it at any repository. 19 scanners run in parallel, each checking a different attack surface. The correlation engine then cross-references findings across 27 rules to detect compound threats that no single scanner would catch (like dynamic import + network fetch = deferred payload loading).

The result is a severity-ranked verdict with exit codes designed for CI/CD gating.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexgreensh/repo-forensics.git
cd repo-forensics
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh /path/to/repo
```

No pip install. No API keys. No Docker. No dependencies.

> **Installed via Claude Code plugin marketplace?** Please enable auto-update after installing. Claude Code ships third-party marketplaces with auto-update **off by default**, and plugin authors cannot change that default. So you will not get new scanners, updated IOCs, or critical detection fixes automatically unless you turn it on. In Claude Code: `/plugin` → **Marketplaces** tab → select your repo-forensics marketplace → **Enable auto-update**. One-time, ten seconds, and your security scanner stays current with the threat landscape. If you installed via `git clone` instead, you are already on the fast path — `git pull` when you want fresh IOCs, or run `--update-iocs` to refresh just the indicator set.

```bash
# Focused AI skill/MCP scan (10 scanners, faster)
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh /path/to/skill --skill-scan

# Track file integrity between scans
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh /path/to/repo --watch

# Pull latest threat indicators before scanning
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh /path/to/repo --update-iocs

# CI/CD machine-readable output
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh /path/to/repo --format json

# Verify your own installation hasn't been tampered with
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh /path/to/repo --verify-install
```

---

## Scan Your Own Projects

Already have projects installed? Run repo-forensics on your existing codebase to check for compromised dependencies, supply chain artifacts, and post-incident traces.

```bash
# Scan a single project
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh ~/my-app

# Scan your entire projects folder
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh ~/Projects

# Check if you were hit by the axios attack (March 31, 2026)
# or liteLLM .pth injection, or any SANDWORM campaign package
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh ~/Projects
```

The post-incident scanner automatically checks:
- **node_modules** for known malicious package directories (even after dropper self-cleanup)
- **npm cache** (`~/.npm/_cacache/`) for cached compromised tarballs
- **npm install logs** (`~/.npm/_logs/`) for references to compromised packages or C2 domains
- **Host artifacts**: RAT binaries, LaunchAgent/LaunchDaemon persistence (macOS)

This catches attacks that designed to evade detection. The axios dropper deletes itself and rewrites package.json to hide its tracks, but the npm cache and node_modules directory survive.

---

## Forensify — Audit Your Agent Stack (v2.5)

repo-forensics scans code you're about to install. **forensify** scans what you've already installed and forgot about.

Over time you accumulate skills, MCP servers, hooks, plugins, commands, and credentials across every agent framework you use. Nobody keeps track. That credential file from three months ago is still world-readable. That hook script symlinks to a directory outside your stack. Two of your ecosystems have a known bug where one silently overwrites the other's OAuth tokens.

Point forensify at your global stack, a specific project, or any directory with agent configs. It tells you what's there, what's exposed, and what to fix.

```bash
# What's accumulated across all my agent stacks?
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh --inventory

# Which ecosystems do I have installed?
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh --inventory --list-ecosystems

# Audit a specific project's agent surface
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh --inventory --target /path/to/my-project

# Audit only my Codex setup
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh --inventory --target ~/.codex
```

### What it audits

**Four ecosystems** — Claude Code, Codex CLI, OpenClaw, NanoClaw. Auto-detected from your machine, no configuration needed.

**Installed skills and plugins** — Every skill and plugin across all detected ecosystems is inspected for prompt injection attacks (HTML comment injection, frontmatter poisoning), suspicious tool definitions (schema poisoning, exfiltration URLs), manifest drift between installed and declared versions, and cross-ecosystem name collisions where the same skill exists in multiple stacks with different code.

**MCP server configs** — Registered MCP servers are checked for tool poisoning patterns, overly broad permissions, and rug-pull enablers (servers that could silently change behavior after initial trust).

**Hooks and auto-execution** — Hook scripts are inspected for symlinks targeting directories outside the agent stack, permission anomalies (world-writable hook scripts), and unexpected execution chains.

**Project-scope scanning** — Point `--target` at any project directory and forensify finds project-level agent configs: `.claude/` settings and commands, `CLAUDE.md`, `.mcp.json`, `.agents/`, `.env`, hooks, skills. The stuff people set up quickly during a sprint and never revisit.

**Ten surface categories** — Skills, commands, agents, memory files, brain files, hooks, MCP servers, plugins, settings, credentials. Each with file metadata: permissions, modification times, symlink targets, sizes.

**Credential permission auditing** — World-readable `.env` files and API key stores surface as findings. For Codex `auth.json`, forensify reports auth mode (apiKey vs OAuth), token staleness, and file permissions without ever reading the actual token values.

**Cross-ecosystem intelligence** — Findings that only exist when multiple stacks coexist on the same machine. The `openai/codex#54506` credential overwrite bug fires when both Codex and OpenClaw are detected. `AGENTS.md` conflicts across stacks are surfaced. Same skill name in multiple ecosystems with different versions triggers a drift warning.

### What it doesn't do

Forensify is read-only. It doesn't fix, patch, or quarantine anything. It doesn't scan external code before install (that's repo-forensics' job). It doesn't read credential values, only file metadata. It's the X-ray, not the surgery.

---

## Auto-Scan Hook (v2)

v2 adds a PostToolUse hook that automatically scans when you install or clone anything. No manual invocation needed.

**What triggers it:**
- `git clone`, `git pull`, `pip install`, `npm install/update`, `yarn add`, `gem install/update`, `cargo install`, `go get/install`, `brew install/upgrade`, `openclaw install/update`, `clawhub install/publish`
- `curl ... | sh` or `wget ... | sh` (instant CRITICAL, no scan needed)

**What it does:**
1. Detects install/clone/update commands in Bash tool calls (<10ms for non-matching commands)
2. Checks package names against the IOC database (known malicious packages)
3. For cloned repos: runs 6 targeted scanners in parallel (dependencies, secrets, lifecycle, skill_threats, manifest_drift, runtime_dynamism)
4. For `git pull`: scans CWD for threats introduced by the update
5. Returns findings as inline context in Claude Code

### Pre-Execution Gate (v2.6)

A PreToolUse hook blocks known-malicious packages and pipe-to-shell commands **before** the command runs:

- **IOC-only**: Checks package names against the IOC database. No full scans, no subprocess calls.
- **<10ms latency**: Fast path for non-matching commands. IOC matches <200ms.
- **Graceful degradation**: Missing IOC database → approve. Never silently blocks legitimate work.
- **Exit codes**: 0 = approve, 2 = block (Claude Code convention).

**Setup as a plugin:**
```bash
# From the repo-forensics directory:
ln -s $(pwd) ~/.claude/plugins/repo-forensics
```

The hook fires automatically on every Bash command. Non-matching commands exit in <10ms with zero overhead.

### Session Security Scanner (v2.6.4)

A SessionStart hook that detects changes to plugins, skills, and MCP servers between sessions:

- **Change detection**: Compares SHA256 checksums against a cached baseline. Only scans what actually changed.
- **Two-tier scan**: Fast IOC check (milliseconds) + full 19-scanner deep scan on changed items (catches zero-day supply chain attacks, obfuscated code, C2 beaconing, manifest drift).
- **Threat database refresh**: Updates IOC and CISA KEV databases once per day (2-5s). Uses stale caches gracefully if offline.
- **Sub-1ms common case**: When nothing changed (99% of sessions), the scanner exits in <1ms.
- **Kill switch**: Set `REPO_FORENSICS_SESSION_SCAN=0` to disable.

| Scenario | Latency |
|----------|---------|
| Nothing changed | 0.9ms |
| 1 plugin changed (fast IOC) | 1.3ms |
| 1 plugin changed (+ deep scan) | 2-10s |
| Daily threat DB refresh | +2-5s |
| Kill switch | 0.02ms |

---

## As a Claude Code Skill

The `skills/repo-forensics/` directory is a self-contained [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) skill. A legacy `skill/` symlink is preserved for existing installs; new usage should reference the canonical `skills/repo-forensics/` path.

```bash
ln -s $(pwd)/repo-forensics/skills/repo-forensics ~/.claude/skills/repo-forensics
```

Then just ask:

> "Audit this repo before I add it as a dependency"
>
> "Is this MCP server safe to use?"
>
> "Run forensics on ~/Downloads/new-plugin"

---

## OpenClaw / ClawHub / NanoClaw

Scan any skill from ClawHub or the OpenClaw ecosystem before installing:

```bash
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh ~/downloads/suspicious-skill --skill-scan
```

Auto-detects agent skills across ecosystems (Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex, Cursor, generic MCP) and runs targeted checks:
- **Frontmatter validation**: missing author, overly broad triggers, description injection
- **tools.json Full-Schema Poisoning**: hidden instructions in tool definitions and input schemas
- **Agent config injection**: prompt injection in SOUL.md, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, memory files
- **ClawHavoc campaign IOCs**: known C2 IPs, AMOS stealer delivery patterns, malicious authors
- **.clawhubignore bypass**: patterns that hide malicious code from ClawHub's own scanner

---

## GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Security gate
  uses: alexgreensh/repo-forensics@v2
  with:
    mode: full           # or skill-scan
    format: text         # or json, summary
    update-iocs: true    # pull latest indicators
```

| Exit Code | Meaning | CI/CD Action |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `0` | Clean | Pass |
| `1` | High / medium findings | Warn |
| `2` | Critical findings | Block merge |

---

## Highlights

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| **DAST scanner** | Executes hook scripts with 8 malicious payloads in a sandbox. Detects env leaks, timeouts, command injection, path traversal. |
| **File integrity monitor** | SHA256 baselines for `.claude/settings.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, hook scripts. `--watch` detects unauthorized changes between scans. |
| **IOC auto-update** | `--update-iocs` pulls latest C2 IPs, malicious domains, and known-bad packages from a hosted feed. Falls back to hardcoded IOCs offline. |
| **Installation verification** | `--verify-install` checks that repo-forensics itself hasn't been tampered with (checksums.json). |
| **GitHub Action** | `action.yml` for CI/CD integration with exit code gating. |
| **Runtime behavior prediction** | Detects code that will change behavior after install: time bombs, dynamic imports, fetch-then-execute, self-modification, rug pull enablers. |
| **Manifest drift detection** | Compares declared dependencies vs actual imports. Catches phantom deps, runtime installs, and conditional import+install fallbacks. |
| **812 pytest tests** | Full test coverage across 20 test files with fixture repos containing known vulnerabilities. |
| **Shared core** | Duplicated `scan_patterns()` extracted to `forensics_core.py`. Silent exceptions replaced with structured findings. |
| **Agent skill scanning** | Auto-detects skills across Claude Code, OpenClaw, Codex, Cursor, and MCP. Checks frontmatter, tools.json, agent configs, .clawhubignore for injection and ClawHavoc patterns. |

---

## Correlation Engine

Individual findings are useful. Compound findings are devastating. The correlation engine connects dots across scanners with 27 rules:

| Pattern | Finding | Severity |
|---------|---------|----------|
| env/credential read + network POST | **Data Exfiltration** | critical |
| base64 encoding + exec/eval | **Obfuscated Code Execution** | critical |
| prompt injection + code execution | **Prompt-Assisted RCE** | critical |
| lifecycle hook + network call | **Install-Time Theft** | critical |
| SQL injection + MCP tool code | **SQL Prompt Escalation** | critical |
| tool metadata poisoning + exec | **Tool Poisoning Chain** | critical |
| unicode smuggling + prompt injection | **Hidden Instruction Attack** | high |
| sensitive file read + network call | **Credential Theft** | high |
| dynamic import + network fetch | **Deferred Payload Loading** | critical |
| time/counter trigger + exec/eval | **Time-Triggered Malware** | critical |
| dynamic tool description + MCP server | **MCP Rug Pull Enabler** | high |
| phantom dependency + network call | **Shadow Dependency with Network** | critical |
| pipe exfiltration + network sink | **Shell Script Data Exfiltration Chain** | critical |
| tools.json poisoning + prompt injection | **Agent Skill Compound Attack** | critical |
| .pth file + base64/exec | **Python Startup Injection (liteLLM-style)** | critical |
| .pth file + known IOC | **Known Supply Chain .pth Attack** | critical |
| git dependency + lifecycle hook | **Git Dependency with Lifecycle Hook** | high |
| missing integrity + untrusted URL | **Lockfile Tampering Indicator** | critical |
| command-jacking + network call | **Command-Jacking Chain** | critical |
| model confusion + code execution | **Model Confusion RCE** | critical |
| compromised action + secrets | **Compromised Action Exfil** | critical |
| audio steganography + network | **Steganographic Payload Delivery** | critical |
| npm publish + token access | **NPM Worm Propagation** | critical |
| destructive command + credential access | **Destructive Fallback** | critical |

---

## Runtime Behavior Prediction

The #1 gap in AI agent security: code that passes static analysis at install time but changes behavior at runtime. Repello AI showed tool poisoning succeeds 72.8% of the time. The `runtime_dynamism` and `manifest_drift` scanners close this gap.

| Attack | How It Works | Scanner Detection |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **MCP rug pull** | Tool description sourced from database or API, changed after approval | Dynamic description from `db.query()`, `requests.get()`, `os.environ` |
| **Time bomb** | Malicious code activates after a hardcoded date or invocation count | `datetime.now() > datetime(2026,6,1)`, unix timestamp comparisons |
| **Deferred payload** | Downloads and executes code at runtime, not at install | `requests.get(url).text` piped to `eval()`, runtime `pip install` |
| **Self-modification** | Constructs executable code from bytecode or rewrites own source | `types.CodeType()`, `marshal.loads()`, `open(__file__, 'w')` |
| **Phantom dependency** | Code imports modules not declared in manifest | `import evil_helper` with no entry in `requirements.txt` |
| **Conditional install** | `try: import X except: os.system("pip install X")` | AST detection of try/except import with install fallback |

Research basis: CVE-2026-2297 (SourcelessFileLoader), PylangGhost RAT (March 2026), Socket.dev NuGet time bombs (Nov 2025), Check Point MCP rug pull (Feb 2026), OWASP MCP03/MCP07.

---

## Why Not the Alternatives?

| Tool | What It Does | Gap |
|------|-------------|-----|
| Gitleaks / TruffleHog | Secrets scanning | Secrets only. No prompt injection, MCP attacks, taint tracking, or supply chain. |
| Semgrep | Static analysis with rules | Requires config. Not AI-skill-aware. No MCP, no unicode smuggling, no DAST. |
| `mcp-scan` | MCP server audit | Uploads your code to a cloud API. |
| GuardDog | Python package scanning | Python only. No MCP, no skills, no source-level analysis. |
| ClawSec | OpenClaw security suite | 8 external dependencies. Wrapper around semgrep/bandit. No correlation engine. |
| VirusTotal + ClawHub | ClawHub signature scanning | Surface-level. Signature-based, not structural. No prompt injection detection, no taint tracking. |
| Manual review | Reading code | Misses zero-width unicode, cross-file taint flows, tool description injection. |

**repo-forensics:** 19 scanners. Zero dependencies. Fully offline. Runtime behavior prediction. Post-incident forensics. Built for the AI agent ecosystem.

---

## CVE + CISA KEV Auto-Enrichment (v2.6)

The scanner automatically knows the latest CVEs and actively-exploited vulnerabilities. No manual database, no API keys, no phoning home beyond two public feeds.

- **OSV (Open Source Vulnerabilities):** Every pinned `(ecosystem, package, version)` seen in a manifest or lockfile is queried against `api.osv.dev`. Matches emit a `cve` finding with CVSS-mapped severity and suggested fix versions.
- **CISA KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities):** CVE aliases are cross-referenced against the CISA KEV catalog — CVEs confirmed actively exploited in the wild. Any match is escalated to **CRITICAL** (category `cve-kev`) regardless of CVSS, because in-the-wild exploitation is the strongest prioritization signal.
- **Caches:** KEV catalog cached 24h (`~/.cache/repo-forensics/kev.json`). Per-package OSV queries cached 24h (LRU-capped, mode 0o600, atomic writes).
- **Offline:** `--offline` uses cached data only. `--no-vulns` disables the feature. `--update-vulns` refreshes the KEV catalog before scanning.
- **Hardening:** Hardcoded feed URLs (no SSRF surface), HTTPS-only, response size caps, fail-closed CVE regex, log-injection sanitizer for untrusted summaries, PEP 503 canonical package names, short-TTL negative cache to prevent retry storms.

```bash
# Standalone package check
python3 skills/repo-forensics/scripts/vuln_feed.py --query npm lodash 4.17.20

# Full scan with fresh KEV data
./skills/repo-forensics/scripts/run_forensics.sh /path/to/repo --update-vulns
```

## Configuration

Suppress known false positives with `.forensicsignore`:

```text
tests/fixtures/secrets.json
vendor/legacy/*
docs/examples/unsafe-demo.py
```

Note: `.forensicsignore` is itself scanned. Broad wildcard patterns like `*` are flagged as critical (likely attacker-planted).

## Security Disclaimer

Repo Forensics is a **defense-in-depth tool** — it adds layers of automated detection but **does not guarantee complete protection** against all threats. No security tool can.

- This software is provided **as-is**, without warranty of any kind. The author is not responsible for any security incidents, data loss, or damages resulting from the use or inability to use this tool.
- Repo Forensics relies on pattern matching, heuristic analysis, and known-threat databases (IOCs, CISA KEV, OSV). **Novel zero-day attacks, sophisticated obfuscation, or threats not yet cataloged may evade detection.**
- This tool is **not a substitute** for professional security audits, penetration testing, or a comprehensive security program.
- Always verify findings manually. Both false positives and false negatives are possible.
